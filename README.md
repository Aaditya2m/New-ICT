**Introduction: Aaditya Mali**

Hello, I'm Aaditya Mali, and I'm passionate about technology and programming. I hold a Master's in Computer Applications (MCA), which has equipped me with a solid foundation in software development and computer science principles. My favorite programming languages are Python and SQL, where I enjoy crafting efficient and elegant solutions to complex problems. Additionally, I have a keen interest in web development, particularly HTML, which allows me to create dynamic and visually appealing websites. When I'm not coding, you can often find me immersed in the world of video games, where I enjoy exploring virtual worlds and challenging myself with strategic gameplay.
